-created "testintro" and commented out "IntroTilemap" in order to test out using the tileset included. As a result, "introtilemap.bin" is not used here.

-Enabled interrupts, added interrupt handler
-added IntroStory_MainLoop, IntroStory_AnimateRow, and IntroStory_Frame
-put everything into .sections

-Fixed interrupts (possibly), added MemoryFill for RAM, program now loops infinitely on WaitForVBlank for testing purposes

boy it's been a bit, huh?
-reworked DrawComplexString (again) to use stringmaps
-actually using IntroStory_MainLoop now
-rewrote parts of IntroStory_AnimateRow
-added DrawPalette, the one thing i forgot to put in the last couple of times and why text didnt change colors
-commented IntroStory_AnimateRow

ISSUES:
-mildly seizure inducing visuals
-everything is slow as dirt, may be due to too many calls?
-background is now black for some reason
